# cython-example

This is a dummy project/tutorial to get familiar with Cython to write Python wrappers for existing C/C++ code. I wanted to start out small before wrapping an existing camera API I am going to use in one of my future projects.

## Building the module

Build the module using `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
